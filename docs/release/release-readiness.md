# Release Readiness

## Purpose

Prepare Open Local Audit for a professional GitHub and npm release. Do not publish until the CLI has real behavior, tests, examples, and reviewed package contents.

## GitHub readiness checklist

- [x] Repository created.
- [x] README is accurate and not overstated.
- [x] Product brief is current.
- [x] License selected.
- [x] Contributing guide added.
- [x] Security policy added.
- [x] Code of conduct decision made.
- [x] GitHub Actions runs tests.
- [x] Example reports committed.
- [x] Changelog started.
- [x] First release notes drafted.

## npm readiness checklist

- [x] Package name confirmed available.
- [x] `package.json` metadata complete.
- [x] `bin` entry points to compiled CLI.
- [x] Package exports are intentional.
- [x] `files` list prevents accidental publishing.
- [x] `npm pack --dry-run` reviewed.
- [x] Install test from packed tarball passes.
- [x] CLI smoke test passes through `npx`.
- [x] Version matches planned GitHub release tag.

## Quality gates

Before release:

```bash
npm test
npm run lint
npm run build
npm pack --dry-run
```

The preferred single command is:

```bash
npm run release-check
```

Add project-specific commands once implementation starts.

Current project-specific verification:

```bash
npm audit
node dist/cli.js --help
npm pack
npx --yes --package ./open-local-audit-0.4.0.tgz open-local-audit --help
```

## First release recommendation

Use `v0.1.0` only after:

- single URL scan works,
- JSON and Markdown reports work,
- at least 10 rules exist,
- tests cover rule engine and report generation,
- example report is committed.

Use `v0.0.x` only for private/internal test packages if needed.
